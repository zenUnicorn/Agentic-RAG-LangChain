# Agentic-RAG.

This repository contains a full Q&A pipeline using the LangChain framework, Pinecone as a vector database, and Tavily as an Agent. The data used are transcriptions of TEDx Talks. A short description of how Tokenizers and Embeddings work is included.

The main steps taken to build the RAG pipeline can be summarized as follows:

* **Data Ingestion**: load data from CSV file

* **Tokenization**: how a tokenizer works

* **Embeddgings**: how an embedding works with cosine similarity concept

* **Indexing**: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for indexing in chunks

* **Vector Store**: Pinecone with several namespace (multi-tenancy)

* **QA Chain Retrieval**: RetrievalQA with memory and agents

## üìê Set Up

The documents are loaded and indexed using **CSVLoader** in the initial project phase. Indexing is a fundamental process for storing and organizing data from diverse sources into a vector store, a structure essential for efficient storage and retrieval. This process involves the following steps:

- Select a splitting method and its hyperparameters: we will use the **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**.

- Select the embeddings model: in our case, the **OpenAI**

- Select a Vector Store: **Pinecone**.

Storing text chunks along with their corresponding embedding representations, capturing the semantic meaning of the text. These embeddings facilitate easy retrieval of chunks based on their semantic similarity. 

After indexing, a QA Chain Retrieval Pipeline is set up to check the Q&A's functioning and performance. Memory and Agents are included in the process.
